"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nGeneral\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nIn 1827 the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum was founded, on six acres of freehold land lying just off the Old Kent Road. It consists of a group of onestoreyed houses, chapel, chaplain's residence, board and court rooms, library, &amp;c., set round two green lawns. The Duke of Sussex was its first patron in 1827, and he was succeeded by the Prince Consort, on whose death the Prince of Wales assumed the office. The idea of establishing an institution wherein the distressed members of the licensed victuallers' trade, and their wives or widows, might be enabled to spend the latter part of their days in peace and quietness, was conceived by the late Mr. Joseph Proud Hodgson, in the year 1826, when he called a meeting of several influential gentlemen in the trade, and ventilated his views; and, after serious consideration, it was determined that a society should be formed under the title of the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum.\n</p>\n<p>\nSubscriptions were solicited, and the hearty response that was accorded to the scheme by those most deeply interested in its success enabled the committee to purchase the land above mentioned, upon which it was resolved to erect an asylum, to consist of one hundred and one separate houses, containing three rooms each, besides the requisite conveniences. In May, 1828, the foundation-stone was laid, with full Masonic honours, by the Duke of Sussex, in the presence of a distinguished company, many of whom in after years exhibited a sincere attachment to the institution. At this time it was determined by the promoters of the institution to erect the central portion of the building, to consist of forty-three houses, which were perfected, and speedily became the abode of as many deserving individuals.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe applicants for admission being numerous, it was deemed advisable to perfect the asylum as early as circumstances would permit, and consequently, in the year 1831, the south wing was erected, and in 1833 the north wing, thus completing the original design of the institution. The friends of the society, being relieved of the anxiety of erecting additional houses, in the year 1835 turned their attention to the advisability of granting weekly allowances of money to the inmates of the asylum, in order to provide them with the necessaries of life, and, as might be imagined, the proposal met with cordial approval, and allowances were then commenced, since which period they have been increased from time to time, until they have reached the sum of twelve shillings per week for married couples and eight shillings for single persons?members of the Incorporated Society of Licensed Victuallers receiving one shilling per week extra. In addition to the allowances, a weekly supply of coal is granted to each inmate, besides being supplied with medical attendance, medicine, and wine, when recommended by the medical officer. In 1842 a charter of incorporation was granted to the institution, and in the following year, on the death of the Duke of Sussex, Prince Albert became patron.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1849 was commenced the \"ladies' wing,\" comprising twenty-three habitations, the foundationstone being laid by H.R.H. the Prince Consort: this wing was completed in the following year. Several years having elapsed since an addition was made to the asylum, this important subject was considered, and so readily approved of by those who had the management of the institution, that in the year 1858 a new wing was commenced, the asylum being again honoured by its royal patron condescending to lay the foundation-stone. These buildings were designated the Albert Wing, in compliment to his Royal Highness, and consist of thirty-four houses.\n</p>\n<p>\nA donation of one thousand guineas having been made to the institution in 1866, by a Mr. William Smalley, it was resolved that the only remaining space on the asylum grounds available for building purposes should be utilised. This was accordingly carried out, and ten additional houses built, which were named the Smalley Wing, the foundation-stone being laid by the Duke of Edinburgh. This addition completed the asylum as a building, and it now consists of one hundred and seventy separate and distinct houses.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe beautiful little chapel is enriched with stained-glass memorial windows, and also several handsome marble tablets, in memory of donors to the institution; whilst upon the grounds in front of the building, and facing the Asylum Road, is erected a marble statue of the late Prince Consort, which was unveiled in 1864 by the Prince of Wales.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe expenses attending the institution are about \u00a37,000 annually, which is met by the subscriptions among the members of the trade, by bequests, by the proceeds of a ball given annually at Willis's Rooms or the Freemasons' Tavern, and also by the proceeds of the anniversary festival.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

According to the Civilian War Dead Register of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, three residents were killed by the blast.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe damaged section was repaired in full in 1950 - however it is still possible to see the site of the bomb impact, as the brick used to repair the building is of slightly darker colour than its surroundings.

He was the head of the town's cemetery and helped arrange funeral for German prisoners from the camp.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow Woolsey's daughter Cynthia Russell, 76, has unearthed the stylish black and white sketches in a drawer after having a spring-clean.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey include pictures of the gateway to St John's Abbey, the Royal Grammar School and 'Theater Camp 186' where Arnolds lived.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a girl Mrs Russell met the artist and a friend, Bernhard Dieters, who were let out of the camp and allowed to draw Colchester's landmarks.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was about 11 years old and I remember my father met up with two trustees who were prisoners of war.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They had been trusted to leave the camp and speak to him about funeral arrangements. He became friends with them which is remarkable really.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He always invited them into the living room rather than the office and my mother would make them a cup of tea.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOn being repatriated in 1947 they handed over the sketches as a small thank you present, she recalled.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer father, who had 10 children, kept them until his death in 1993. Mrs Russell then took possession of them and put them in a drawer, only to be forgotten for 15 years.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said her father was injured twice in World War One, once by a bayonet in the foot and the second time when a shell hit his head.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was later seconded to the RAF and flew bombing raids over Germany in bi-planes.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she said he never forgot his enemies were human. She said: \"My father was an incredibly compassionate man. He saw the prisoners as men who had been fighting for their country the same as him, and who had been captured. They were human beings to him.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
