"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nGeneral\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nThe Newsman 15 June 1907\n</p>\n<p>\nSTRANGE CASE AT COLCHESTER<br />\nAt Colchester Police-court on Tuesday, John Joseph Burke, a private in the K.R.R. and his wife, Norah Burke, pleaded not guilty to a charge of having neglected their son, John Wm. Burke---Mr H. W. Jones prosecuted on behalf of the N.S.P.C.C., and Mr A. G. Hawkins defended.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Jones said that the father earned 18s a week, and his wife 8s. The defendants were in lodgings for which they paid 4s weekly. Dr Clowes found that the child in question was suffering from bronchitis and pneumonia. He ordered plenty of milk and eggs. Instead of giving the eggs and the milk to the child the defendants consumed it themselves. The female defendant was addicted to drink, and was an inveterate smoker, having on several occasions set the bedding on fire. The child was sent to Essex and Colchester Hospital where it increased 6 3/4 1bs in weight in three weeks. It was still in hospital, and would have to undergo an operation.---Evidence was called--Mr Hawkins for the defence asked the Bench to overlook the questions raised by the prosecution as to the drinking and the smoking, which had nothing whatever to do with the case. he said that the evidence of the chief witness was largely influenced by a quarrel she had had with Mrs. Burke about some money which was owing, and also about some cartridges---Mrs. Burke, the mother, denied having hit the child or having thrown a tin at it. She admitted that she gave the child condensed milk. The child's condition was due to illness.---The male defendant said he had never known his wife to come home drunk, and gave evidence as to a dispute that arose in which Mrs. Ratcliffe threatened to go to the N.S.P.C.C. and say that the witness and his wife were iltreating their child. The witness has admitted that his wife smoked, but denied she would smoke four packets a day. Neither had she smoked in bed and set fire to the clothing.---The Chairman said the Bench considered there was not sufficient evidence to warrant conviction, and the case was accordingly dismissed.---Mr. Jones asked for the costs to be remitted as against the Society, but the Bench did not accede to the application.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
