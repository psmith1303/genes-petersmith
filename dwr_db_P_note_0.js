"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nPlace Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nBorough Road .... Queen\u2019s Buildings, blocks of seven storey model housing tenements that were built on the site in 1881.  These were not as well designed as other model housing dwellings and blocked out the sun on every side and rendered the lower floors dark on even the brightest days.  The estate suffered some bomb damage in World War II and was demolished as unfit for human habitation in 1977.  The gloomy tenements were replaced by the existing more modern social housing built by Southwark Council.\n</p>\n<p>\nQueens Buildings<br />\n1881-4 (now demolished)<br />\n, <br />\nNational Model Dwellings Company<br />\n667 dwellings, 1,210 rooms, 3,321 residents\n</p>\n<p>\nThis development  was the largest and densest in north Southwark prior to the Great War . It was <br />\nbuilt on the site of the Queen\u2019s Bench Prison by MR J.W. Hobbs as a private venture, but  the <br />\nwhole  site  was  soon  purchased  by The  National  Model  Dwellings  Company.  There  is  little <br />\nstatistical information available on the construction or design of the site, but what information is <br />\navailable gives conflicting views on the merits of the buildings. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe 1885 report by the Mansion House Council is damning: <br />\n<em>\u201cIn the planning of this estate, and of the internal details of the dwellings, it is impossible to speak with praise. </em><br />\n<em>The closed-in yards, the narrow passages at the back (in which it is, to say the least, surprising to find a public </em><br />\n<em>house), all tell of want of proper care for ventilation and due regard for the benefit of sunlight; while the dark </em><br />\n<em>staircase,  unprovided  with  that  front-to-back  ventilation  so  needful  to  prevent  their  becoming carriers of </em><br />\n<em>disease from floor to floor, the very defective accommodation for washing and drying, and the still more defective </em><br />\n<em>arrangements for dust disposal, are errors of a very serious nature\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
