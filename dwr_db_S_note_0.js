"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nThis data collection contains marriage records and marriage banns dating from 1754-1921 from more than 10,000 Church of England parish registers (including Bishop?s Transcripts) from parishes in the greater London area that have been deposited at London Metropolitan Archives and those formerly held by Guildhall Library Manuscripts section. A full list of the Church of England parishes in London can be found in the more help section. These have been arranged in two ways, alphabetically by name and alphabetically by modern London borough.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt should be noted that some churches continued to record marriages in composite registers after 1753 and therefore you should also check Baptism?s Marriages and Burials 1538-1812.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
